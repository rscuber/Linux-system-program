Version 2017-7

Environment requirement: a compiler supports C++14 (gcc-5.4+)
The easiest way to setup environment is to intall Debian-9(stretch), and run:
sudo apt-get install build-essential

You may need docker or VMware if you're under Windows.
No matter how you do it, just find out a workable Linux machine and do the task.

Please read the comments in task.cc carefully and finish the task.
You're NOT allowed to modify meta.hh.

When you finish, run `make run', when it's OK for you, please submit all things.

Good luck!
